Benchmarks about Machine Learning
=================================

This project started with my first attempt
to bring a modification to :epkg:`scikit-learn`.
My first `pull request <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13290>`_
was about optimizing the computation of polynomial features.
I reused the template to measure various implementations
or models.
